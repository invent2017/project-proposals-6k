What we doing now:
- an app called 'bored' that's cool
- we are still strugging with Android Studio (the updates take forever)
 > we have the map with marker thing working
 > we have the show current location thing working
 > but we don't/sort-of understand the code
 > we cannot write our own code yet
 > we know how to do the UI layout thingy
- the water meter
 > we've lowkey given up on it because it's not as fun
 > yea.


What worked:
- the tutorials on Google
- Android Studio downloads, i guess. but not because we did great stuff

What didn't:
- Lik Hern's app emulator --> solution: use phone!
- understanding code --> solution: learn more!
- coding efficiently or making actual progress --> solution: learn more!
